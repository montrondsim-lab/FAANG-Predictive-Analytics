# FAANG-Predictive-Analytics

## Project Summary
This repository contains a predictive analytics project focusing on the stock movements of FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google). The goal is to predict daily stock price direction and compare the performance of different machine learning models.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on FAANG stock data.
- Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict the direction of stock price movement.
- Translate technical findings into business insights and recommendations.
- Reflect on ethical considerations in predictive modeling.

## Dataset Description
We use a real-world dataset of daily stock prices for FAANG companies, sourced from Kaggle. It includes over 1,000 observations with features like daily closing prices, volume, and returns. The prediction target is whether the next day’s closing price will be higher or lower than the previous day’s.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Includes the EDA and modeling notebooks with detailed explanations.
- `images/`: Stores visualizations and plots.
- `reports/`: Contains the final report (PDF/Markdown).

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the EDA and modeling notebooks in Google Colab (links provided below).
3. Follow the steps in the notebooks to reproduce the analysis.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (3.x)
- **Google Colab** for running notebooks
- **pandas, numpy** for data manipulation
- **matplotlib, seaborn** for visualizations
- **scikit-learn** for modeling
